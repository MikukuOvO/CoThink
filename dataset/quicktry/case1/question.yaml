  I am being brainwashed. You are a product of your environment. First they isolate me by spreading lies to distance those close to me or if they are more persistent in resisting them they resort to threats.​
  Then they create a parameter and environment with people who very convincingly act like I am guilty of something. That doesn't work right away but it's a referent group. In time if everyone around you repeats how stupid you are or the opposite. You will start believing that. They are counting on repetition. The psychological methods include people who convincingly act like I am guilty of something,  songs on the radio, actors that don't talk to leave evidence just. Act. Like pantomime.​
  They are hoping that this isolation along with the repetitive messages of guilt and blame will eventually make me believe their story. Which they probably hope will lead to some sort of confession. ​
  Furthermore any attempt to resist or talk is met with threats about my family members lives and they are willing to go as far as threatening my ex as well. Now they also play a specific chainsaw sound that is probably supposed so signify a no everytime I break through the manipulation. Effectively toying with my willpower.​
  Now this might be done by employing behavioral psychologists, along with the information they are able to collect through my communication means they are able to even engineer my behavior. Hence they can elicit anger, emails, make me release chats or information which I shouldn't. Or even people from a country can purposefully set me against the same country. To create an artificial motive.​
  Now is this able to break the psyche of an independent investigator if there is such. Is also very important.​
